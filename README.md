# **Dynamic Calculator Web App**

<br>

# Hi ðŸ‘‹

<br>

<!-- ## This is a Dynamic Calculator web Application. -->

<!-- This calculator is able to perform simple Mathematical operations like:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division as well as
- Squaring numbers to the power of 2 -->

This is a dynamic calculator web application that is able to perform a combined operation of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, finding the value of numbers raised to the power of two, as well as perform these mathematical operations individually.

The app is built to handle errors such as displaying the error message "Malformed operation" when a user tries to evaluate a malformed mathematical operation. The app also throws the error message "Empty operation" when the user tries to evaluate an empty math operation by not entering any math operation into the calculator.

If the application is being run on an Android mobile phone, the app vibrates the user's device whilst throwing/displaying these errors. The application also has a theme change feature where users are able to change/switch between a bright and a dark theme to suit their preferred colour scheme appeal.
